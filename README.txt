INFORMATION
-----------
A very basic calculator I created to learn Qt.
It has several bugs but I'm not motivated enough to fix them (they're easy to fix I want to build something else).

-----------
TESTING
-----------
Just open the project in Qtcreator. You need to have qt6 installed (core, gui and widgets). On NixOS, you may use the provided flake by cloning the repository and running "nix develop".

-----------
LICENCE
-----------
No licence, you may do whatever you want with it.
